The Ada Microkernel Project (TAMP)

Author: Luke A. Guest (C) 2011


The aim of this project is to create a simple microkernel using Ada as the
implementation lanaguage.

To get the toolchain built, enter the thirdparty directory, copy the
config-master.inc file to config.inc, edit this and then run the following
command:
  ./build-tools.sh

This will install the various tools required to the directories of your choice.
