Remove the build-rts.sh

Add a check for each tool used, patch, svn, git, bison, flex and exit completely
if they're not available.

Add the options from [6].

Find out how s-hibaen.ads is used, can we use it? In gcc/ada/system.ads there
is a "High_Integrity_Mode" flag which is marked as obsolete. This flag doesn't
exist in the target system specs.

Use SPARK for development?
