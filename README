Introduction
------------ 

The aim of this project is to create a simple microkernel using Ada as the
implementation lanaguage.

To get the toolchain built, enter the thirdparty directory, copy the
config-master.inc file to config.inc, edit this and then run the following
command:
  ./build-tools.sh

This will install the various tools required to the directories of your choice.
On my x86-64 Ubuntu install, this process takes approximately 3GB of disk space.
